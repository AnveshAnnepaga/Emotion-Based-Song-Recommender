# ðŸŽ¶ Emotion-Based Chatbot Song Recommender

## Project Description

This project is a conversational chatbot that recommends songs to users based on their emotional state. By analyzing natural language input, the chatbot classifies the user's mood into one of seven categoriesâ€”happy, calm, sad, angry, neutral, fear, or surpriseâ€”and retrieves a fitting song from a cloud-based database. The system features a modern command-line interface and includes a secure user authentication system to manage and log personalized interactions.

## Key Features

* **Emotional Analysis:** Utilizes a hybrid approach combining a keyword-based system and sentiment polarity to detect a wide range of emotions.
* **Custom Web Interface:** Features a clean, visually appealing, dark-mode UI built with Streamlit.
* **Secure Authentication:**  Implements a robust, self-managed user sign-up and login system using bcrypt for industry-standard password hashing and secure verification.
* **Persistent Data Storage:** Stores and retrieves songs and logs user interactions in a PostgreSQL database managed by Supabase.
* **Professional Interface:** Features a clean, systematic, and visually appealing command-line interface using the `rich` library.

## Technologies Used

* **Core Language**: Python 3.x

* **Frontend/UI**: Streamlit (Framework for the modern, professional web interface)

* **Authentication**: bcrypt (Industry-standard library for secure password hashing and verification)

* **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL Database)

* NLP**: textblob (Library used for emotion analysis)

* **Terminal Output**: rich (Used for professional console output/debugging)

* **API Requests**: requests (Used by services for internal API calls)

* **Configuration**: python-dotenv (Manages secure environment variables)

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with a clear separation of concerns:

-   **CLI (`app.py`)**: The user-facing interface that handles all input/output.
-   **Service Layer (`auth_service.py`, `emotion_analyzer.py`, `song_recommender.py`)**: Contains the core business logic, including authentication, mood detection, and song fetching.
-   **DAO Layer (`supabase_client.py`, `user_logger.py`)**: Handles all direct database operations to ensure data integrity and security.
-   **Cloud Services**: The backend is powered by **Supabase** (for the database) and **Clerk** (for user authentication).
