# ðŸŽ¶ Emotion-Based Chatbot Song Recommender

## Project Description

This project is a conversational chatbot that recommends songs to users based on their emotional state. By analyzing natural language input, the chatbot classifies the user's mood into one of seven categoriesâ€”happy, calm, sad, angry, neutral, fear, or surpriseâ€”and retrieves a fitting song from a cloud-based database. The system features a modern command-line interface and includes a secure user authentication system to manage and log personalized interactions.

## Key Features

* **Emotional Analysis:** Utilizes a hybrid approach combining a keyword-based system and sentiment polarity to detect a wide range of emotions.
* **Personalized Recommendations:** Provides real-time song suggestions tailored to the user's current mood.
* **Secure Authentication:** Implements a user sign-up and login system using Clerk's Backend API for secure user management.
* **Persistent Data Storage:** Stores and retrieves songs and logs user interactions in a PostgreSQL database managed by Supabase.
* **Professional Interface:** Features a clean, systematic, and visually appealing command-line interface using the `rich` library.

## Technologies Used

* **Core Language:** Python 3.x
* **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL Database)
* **Authentication:** Clerk Backend API
* **NLP:** `textblob`
* **Terminal UI:** `rich`
* **API Requests:** `requests`
* **Environment Management:** `python-dotenv`

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with a clear separation of concerns:

-   **CLI (`chatbot.py`)**: The user-facing interface that handles all input/output.
-   **Service Layer (`clerk_service.py`, `emotion_analyzer.py`, `song_recommender.py`)**: Contains the core business logic, including authentication, mood detection, and song fetching.
-   **DAO Layer (`supabase_client.py`, `user_logger.py`)**: Handles all direct database operations to ensure data integrity and security.
-   **Cloud Services**: The backend is powered by **Supabase** (for the database) and **Clerk** (for user authentication).
